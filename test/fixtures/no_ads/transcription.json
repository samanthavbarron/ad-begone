{"duration":150.0,"language":"english","text":"Welcome back to The Midnight Archive, the podcast dedicated to unexplained historical events. I'm your host, Julian Thorne. Tonight's episode covers the strange disappearance of the Blackmoor Lighthouse keepers in eighteen ninety-one. The Blackmoor Lighthouse sat on a remote island off the northern Scottish coast. Three keepers were stationed there at all times, rotating in monthly shifts. On the morning of December fourteenth, a supply vessel arrived to find the lighthouse dark and all three keepers gone. The table inside was set for a meal that had never been eaten. Two of the three sets of outdoor clothing were missing, which was peculiar given the violent storm that had been raging. The third keeper's coat hung by the door, as though he'd left in a hurry. Investigators found the logbook entries increasingly frantic in the days before the disappearance. The final entry simply read, storm still raging, God is over all. Theories have ranged from rogue waves to madness to foul play among the keepers themselves. Marine geologists have since confirmed that unusually large waves can indeed strike that stretch of coast with little warning. The most widely accepted explanation today is that two keepers went out to secure equipment during the storm and were swept away by a massive wave. The third, seeing this from the door, rushed out to help and met the same fate. Whatever happened at Blackmoor, it remains one of the most haunting maritime mysteries ever recorded. That does it for tonight. Join us next week when we explore the lost colony of Roanoke from a new angle. Good night, and stay curious.","segments":[{"id":0,"avg_logprob":-0.2,"compression_ratio":1.5,"end":3.5,"no_speech_prob":0.001,"seek":0,"start":0.0,"temperature":0.0,"text":" Welcome back to The
