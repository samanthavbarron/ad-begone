{"duration":200.0,"language":"english","text":"Welcome to Echoes of Tomorrow, your weekly deep dive into the world of speculative fiction. I'm your host, Diana Crowe. Today we're looking at the works of fictional author Terrence Voss, who wrote the acclaimed Starshade Trilogy. The first book, Dusk Over Meridian, was published in nineteen eighty-seven and introduced readers to the concept of chronal drift. Voss drew inspiration from his time studying geology in New Zealand, where the landscape itself seemed to shift between eras. The second book, The Amber Threshold, expanded the universe considerably. Critics at the time called it overly ambitious, but readers loved it. This episode is sponsored by Fernwood Coffee Roasters. Tired of bland, mass-produced coffee? Fernwood sources single-origin beans from small farms across Central America. Use code ECHOES at fernwoodcoffee dot com for fifteen percent off your first bag. Fernwood Coffee, taste the difference. Back to Voss and the Starshade Trilogy. The third and final book, Convergence Point, tied everything together beautifully. Voss spent seven years writing it, during which time he famously refused all interviews. The ending remains one of the most debated in speculative fiction. Now a word from Glint Toothpaste. Want a brighter smile without harsh chemicals? Glint uses a proprietary mineral blend that whitens naturally over two weeks. Available at major retailers or visit glintsmile dot com. Glint, smile with confidence. That's all for today's episode of Echoes of Tomorrow. Next week we'll be discussing the rise of solarpunk as a literary movement.
