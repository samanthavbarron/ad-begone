{"duration":166.0500030517578,"language":"english","text":"Hey everyone, you're listening to Tangent Mode, the show where we pick a random topic and just see where it goes. I'm Della Huang. Today's random topic pulled straight from our fishbowl is the invention of synthetic rubber. Now I know that doesn't sound thrilling, but trust me, this story has betrayal, explosions, and at least one very angry goat. So it all starts in the early 1900s. Natural rubber was an enormous industry, mostly centered around plantations in Southeast Asia. But a handful of chemists in Europe were trying to figure out how to make rubber from scratch in a laboratory. The first real breakthrough came from a researcher named Henning Voss, who accidentally polymerized isoprene while trying to make a better adhesive for wallpaper. Before we continue, let me tell you about Fenwick notebooks. Whether you're journaling, sketching, or planning world domination, Fenwick's premium notebooks have the smoothest paper you'll ever write on. Their signature ink glide pages prevent bleed through and feathering, even with fountain pens. Check them out at fenwicknotes.com and use code tangent for 15% off. Fenwick, put your thoughts on better paper. All right, back to the rubber. So Henning Voss has this accidental polymer on his hands. Literally, it was stuck to his fingers for three days. He writes up his findings, but his university dismisses the work as irrelevant. Enter Clara Johansson, a rival chemist who saw the potential immediately. She refined the process, and within two years had produced the first commercially viable synthetic rubber compound. The angry goat I mentioned? Apparently, Johansson kept a pet goat in her laboratory, as one does, and the goat ate an entire notebook full of her formulas. She had to recreate six months of work from memory. The goat, whose name was Professor Nibleton, was banished to a nearby farm and reportedly lived to the ripe old age of 19. This episode is sponsored by Quartzy Meal Kits.

And that's the story of synthetic rubber, more or less. There's a lot more to it, involving wartime production and international espionage, but we'll save that for another episode. Thanks for going on this tangent with me. Hit subscribe, tell a friend, and I'll see you next week with whatever we pull out of the fishbowl.
