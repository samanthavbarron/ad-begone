{"duration":1133.97998046875,"language":"english","text":"richest person is gutting the federal government, yet polls show the president starting his second term with higher approval ratings than when he began his first term. And it sends this confusing message about what the electorate actually wants. You have class as a central part of your story, so why don't you think it's a confusing message? Because people that are working class, poor, don't necessarily look at the ultra-rich as their competitors. They want to be rich someday. So they don't necessarily fault the quote-unquote rich for them being rich. Where they do fault them is when it starts affecting them. So they're going to give, you know, Elon and his little weirdos the benefit of doubt, and they're going to give Donald Trump the benefit of doubt until it proves that it's actually affecting them personally, right? And that's when you'll see them start pushing back. If you look, historically speaking, the thing that finally started moving Donald Trump's numbers away before the 2018 elections was when he gave a massive tax cut to the rich. So I think that's what's going to end up happening. I think this administration is going to give a massive tax cut to the rich, and they're going to do it by cutting Medicaid and other programs for the poor. And that's when you're going to see people saying, no, no, no, that's not what I want. So the Democratic message among some Democrats is sort of eat the rich, right? Right. No, it's not going to work. That's not the right message. No, these people want to be rich. They want to be rich. Like most Democrats, the base Democratic voter wants to be rich, and there's nothing wrong with that. And so our job is to expose when there are abuses by quote-unquote the rich, the wealthy, the powerful. Then that's how we get those people that want to aspire to that to vote for Democrats. So Elon Musk, Donald Trump, are these the people who have actually figured out how to connect with the working class? Yes. Yeah. We just had an election that proved that. I mean, why? Well, I think because they are, I think they, you know, both are two things that I think a lot of Democrat politicians are. Number one, they actually understand quote-unquote the consumer, right? It's because they are engaged in every day, you know, one way or the other, trying to talk to the consumer, and in this case, it's the voter. They're salesmen, essentially. Yeah, exactly. And they understand who the client is. The client is the voter. And they don't care, by the way, that's the other thing that's, you know, they don't care how they get the sale done, right? This is why you saw during the campaign, Trump said, you know what, no tax on tips. We're not going to tax security, all this kind of stuff. And, you know, on the other side, people are like, well, that's where they're going to do something and do it in balance to the budget deficit. What did Donald Trump care? He just wanted to win, right? What is Elon Musk going to do? He just wants to win, right? He knows where the voter is, and he'll get there however he can get there. After the break, I asked Senator Gallego about a contentious issue where he's challenged his party, immigration. Listen to the immigration groups because they have good legal advice. Do not listen to immigration groups if they tell you that this is a representation of where Latinos are, because they are totally off. I want to ask you specifically about immigration, which was one of the central issues of the election, as we mentioned, and one that really hurt Democrats. I'm curious how your own story affects your view of the immigration debate. Your parents emigrated from Colombia and Mexico. What was your family's experience with the immigration system? Well, so most of my experience with the immigration system was already kind of done. My mom was a naturalized citizen when I was born. My father was a legal green card holder then. I don't know what his status is now. My experience was, for example, crossing the border fairly easily, back and forth, going to work in Mexico, and then coming back when I used to work on the farm. But then it's also my experience kind of talking to, you know, I have a very extended family on both sides about their frustration, like wanting to come to the United States. For example, talking to family in Mexico that had been waiting for their green card or had been waiting for their work visas and were waiting forever. Or even recently, you know, the last six years with the refugee crisis at the border, hearing from Latinos, immigrant Latinos, saying like, wait a minute, like, why is that person crossing the border and getting a work permit, and my cousin still doesn't have a work permit? So I think kind of being closer to where your everyday Latino is on immigration is really what helped kind of set my policy mindset, because what you're hearing was entirely different from what you're hearing from groups and other opinion leaders about where Latinos were on the border and immigration. And there's nuance within our communities, within the immigrant community, right? They can tell the difference or they tell the difference between recent immigrants that came in legally, immigrants that came in 10 years ago illegally, and refugees and asylum seekers right now. And if you, a lot of them will say that person that came in legally, yes, that person came in 10 years ago, they shouldn't come in illegally, but they're part of the community now, let's give them an opportunity to be US citizens or come out of the shadows. That person that just crossed the border, claiming asylum, and now they get a work permit, that's BS, right? That's not right. If you're in that community, that makes sense to you. But if you're kind of out and looking in, which a lot of Democrats do, that doesn't make sense. They just draw a general idea that they all think the same, and they just don't. As Senator, your first vote was for the Lake and Riley Act. You were one of two Democratic co-sponsors of the bill, the other one being John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. Many in the immigrant advocacy community were, shall we say, unhappy with that position. They have criticized the law. They say it raises due process concerns for immigrants. The big concern is that it will give states more control over immigration policy, essentially gutting federal authority over that. What was your thinking behind voting for the Lake and Riley Act? Well, my thinking was, behind voting it for the second time, because I voted also in the House of Representatives, is that this is, again, a response to talking to voters, and they wanted more immigration control and reform. And look, what happened in Lake and Riley was horrible. These immigration groups, again, have some very valid points in some areas, but where they're attacking or where they're moving is not necessarily in line, again, where the majority of voters or even the immigrant community are. So I heard from them a lot, and the one thing I heard from them is, like, this is not what Latinos want. They don't want this bill. I'm like, that's actually not true. I go home, and there was a lot of support for bills like this. And certainly, I think that there is a mismatch right now. The immigration groups have moved to a point where they somehow started representing that they represent the voice of Latinos, and they don't. They're not even close. And so one of the things I've been very clear, also telling my senators, like, listen to the immigration groups because they have good legal advice. Do not listen to the immigration groups if they tell you that this is a representation of where Latinos are, because they are totally off. And I'm responding to what I saw and heard out in Arizona, and that's why I've supported last year and this year. This bill does seem to want to change the nature of how immigration is done in this country. And writ large, the architect of this administration's immigration policies is Stephen Miller, who in the past has promoted hardline views by citing the work of white nationalist websites, and that's according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There does seem to be a strain in this administration that does want to change the makeup of this country. Without a doubt, yeah. Do you worry that voters' legitimate concerns about our immigration system are being weaponized for ideological ends? Well, absolutely. But this isn't new. Immigration and the border have been weaponized in politics forever, before Donald Trump. I mean, when I was involved in the Arizona Statehouse, it was being weaponized. So none of us should be surprised by it. So then was it hard for you to cast that vote knowing that context? No, because this has been happening for the last 20 years. The context that I worry about is like, how do we get the trust of people back to the point where we can actually bring the immigration conversation to a more normal state of frame? Let me give you a kind of a bigger picture of this. When the Democrats basically dropped the ball on the chaos on the border for many years, we essentially lost the debate on immigration reform for years because the everyday voter doesn't trust us on the border and on immigration reform because for years they saw that chaos on the border and we did nothing. You know, the Biden administration finally moved, but by then it had been so long and the damage had been done. And by the way, for us that care about immigration reform, and we truly do, and I want to see, you know, immigration reform happen. I want to see undocumented families come out of the shadows. I want DREAMers to become citizens, everything else like that. We've been set back for years because we hesitated on asylum seekers when we knew in our guts that what was happening there was an abuse of the system, was unpopular with Democrats, but somehow we decided that we were going to essentially just give the issue to the Republicans. And we could have had a very sane position on this. Do you blame President Biden for that? I blame President Biden, but I also blame a lot of the people that were advising President Biden. A lot of these groups that were advising President Biden. You know, you're only as good as advice that's given to you, but, you know, these immigration groups that I think are looking out for people ended up making the situation a lot worse now. Just understand where you stand on specific issues. For example, should local law enforcement be helping ICE carry out deportations? No, because if you talk to local law enforcement, and especially in Arizona, talking to sheriffs and talking to the police, they don't have the bandwidth. They don't want to do this. They want to keep the community relationships, and like police are there to actually enforce local laws. If it's someone that is a drug runner, a criminal, and they need police backup, sure, why wouldn't you if there's a warrant or anything else like that? But no, you shouldn't have police doing local immigration laws, especially because you can't even afford it. Should migrants be sent to Guantanamo or to prisons in El Salvador? Not migrants that have their due process, and especially not ones that are dangerous, but certainly ones that are severely dangerous, like people that have committed crimes, but we can't legally hold them here. I think there's something to be said about that. I'm surprised. For gang members, criminals, I mean, like, why would you want to keep gang members and criminals that don't even have a legal right to be here and Venezuela won't take them back? I think there is a concern that people that get put into these systems, it's sort of like a black hole. It's a legal limbo. We've been having legal limbo for the immigrant community forever. I mean, Guantanamo has been used for, you know, refugees and asylum seekers prior to this. But not ones that have been in the United States or people who have been caught at sea. Look, at the same time, we're dealing in very different situations. If there is a hardcore criminal that has gone through our judicial system, but we can't actually deport, what are we going to do? I'm not saying, again, we do this for everybody, but there has to be some logical security that we should be thinking about because they're going to end up being criminals again, especially in these very, very vulnerable communities. How have you seen the deportation working in the last three weeks since Trump has taken over? So talking to people in Arizona, talking to ICE agents also, it's caused a lot of fear. Some of the ICE agents are very frustrated also because they feel that they're put on to make an artificial quota. That they first were sent to go after hardcore criminals and now they're kind of being pushed to just grab anybody. So for example, in Arizona, they have a quota of 75 people per day. The frustration, I think, is also in the fact that there isn't really any coordination of need. So for example, they're bringing investigators off ATF, DEA, and HSI who are actually going after real criminals, both U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens, and they're just being thrown in here to actually essentially do a show of force. And so it's a frustration on both sides too. They have families that are living in fear because there's no real communications happening from ICE and the actual agents themselves feel like this is not a good use of my time nor taxpayer dollar for security. You think it's ineffective? I think if Donald Trump actually wanted to get rid of these hardcore criminals, there is an actual way to do this where you would have a lot of these undocumented families and ones I've told you that have been here forever, the ones that have kids that are here, that will likely help you. But when you kind of are trying to cast a wide net, you're going to have everyone hide and you're going to end up probably making a lot of these criminals that are here illegally be able to get away with it. Do you take Donald Trump and his administration at face value that what they're interested in doing is deporting criminals as opposed to deporting immigrants? No, I don't take it at face value. This is why, you know, where can we have our points of leverage to have them focus on that is going to be the harder question. Because right now, you know, with this election, you know, we basically hand them the keys to everything. So what can we do to actually make them focus on these hardcore criminals is going to be the next really the big fight. As you've discussed, there are concerns about Democrats being too deferential to the more liberal parts of the party. Yes, on immigration, but also gender, LGBTQ rights, DEI, whatever it is. And these are all things that the right has been hammering Democrats on for a while. And it seems to be working. So how do Democrats stand for what they believe in without being seen by voters as being outside of the mainstream? Well, I think the first problem is. It's easier for us to be hit as being extremists if we're not also known for something. If we're not fighting, you know, to make someone's life better, to minimize or bring down the cost of living, you know, raise wages, if we're not actively fighting for that, it's going to be easier for people to take the most extreme positions and say, well, that's actually what the Democrats are, right? I think most Americans are actually very much pro-LGBT. I think they're pro-women's rights. I think they're, you know, they're more aligned with Democrats than with Republicans are. But when we aren't identified as at the core of doing something for the kind of grander America, they're just going to be like, see, they're just so focused on these small little niche groups instead of you. And that resonated. But again, we need to recognize that when Democrats fail, when we fail in making people's lives better, and I know, again, someone's going to go, I don't know if you have blogs that attach this podcast, you're going to say, well, the GDP under Biden was the highest and we had the lowest unemployment ever. Ruben Gallego is wrong. Yes, that was all true, but people were not feeling it. People were just not feeling it. And again, if we want to lie to ourselves and say, well, things were really good, the economy was really good, when people were telling us it was not, we're going to continue having this problem. And it's going to be easier for people to take opportunities to take away some of these basic rights if we allow the middle of America to continue to suffer economically.
