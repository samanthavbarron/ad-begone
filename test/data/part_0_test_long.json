{"duration":1133.97998046875,"language":"english","text":"LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO It's been a blizzard of political news over the past few weeks, as President Donald Trump and his billionaire backer Elon Musk try to remake America's government. From dismantling federal agencies to the mass firing of federal workers, the duo's frenzied efforts are testing both the courts and the opposition. Democrats, having lost the Senate and the presidency, are struggling to come up with a unified strategy not only to stop Trump's agenda, but also to win back the voters they need to move towards him in the election. It's a real moment of soul-searching for the party. So over the next month, I'll be having a series of conversations with influential Democratic politicians to understand their internal debates about the way forward. My first is with Arizona's junior Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego. Gallego's win over Republican Carrie Lake was one of the few bright spots for Democrats in November. A former member of the House, Gallego won in a tight race by overperforming Kamala Harris among key demographics that Democrats have struggled with, especially men and Latinos. Gallego is the son of an immigrant single mother and grew up poor. He eventually went to Harvard and then became a Marine fighting in Iraq and ultimately ended up in politics where, he says, his story of struggle and success helped him connect to voters. He has a lot of advice for, and criticism of, Democrats right now, as I discovered when I sat down with him earlier this week in Washington, D.C. Hi, how are you? Gracias. Mucho gusto. Placer tenerte aqui. Oh man, I'm intimidated. Your Spanish is way better than mine. Here's my conversation with Senator Ruben Gallego. Senator, I almost don't know where to start because so much has happened in such a short amount of time. And it occurs to me, you're a first term senator, but you were in the House for about 10 years before that. And you were in Congress during the first Trump administration. I was actually, yeah. So I guess I'm wondering, does this time feel different? It does. And two things. Number one, a lot of what you see Trump is doing now is what he tried the first time around. But this time around, we don't have Republican allies. And what that means is that we're basically fighting on our own. For me, this is more reminiscent of when I was in the Statehouse, when the Republicans had full control of the House, the Senate, and the Governor's match. In Arizona. Yeah, and the Governor's match in Arizona. And there was just no way of stopping it, except for trying to find the best way to bring to light what problems they were causing, what they were violating, what they were going to do. And overall, it's just like turning the state into. And right now, I think that's where you're seeing a lot of the Democratic establishment, party, elected officials trying to figure out what to do. Do you see a shift in how seriously the party is taking this moment? Well, I do think that the party, and at least talking to my colleagues, are starting to see that this is an existential threat if they keep going down this road. If we can't rely on the judiciary to be part of those checks and balances, then what is left? I think what I'm seeing is a lot of people that are just kind of frozen. And it's something that happens a lot when situations come out of the norm. And so people want to make something that's not normal, normal. Because if you actually have to accept the reality, it gets very, very scary. And I guess the big question for Democrats is what it means to be an effective opposition party. And I think there are two issues here, right? One is what Democrats should actually do to counter Trump's actions. And the other is how you should communicate what you're doing. On the first, there is talk of using government spending, which has to be negotiated by March 14th as leverage. Part of the risk is that if there is a shutdown, the Democrats will be blamed for that at a moment when indeed the party is trying to beach voters, rebuild itself, communicate that it is a party worth voting for. Is the risk too high? I mean, the risk is always there. We can't be afraid of failing. That's number one. I think that's the biggest mistake I've seen Democrats do is that we're always afraid. We're always afraid of failing, so we don't take risks. It's okay for us to recognize that that is a potential fallback. But we could also be working to mitigate that somehow. And what does that look like? You know, making sure that we meet the moment where the American public is. And maybe that moment will happen soon. I'm not sure it's March 15th. But making sure that we're talking to them, we're showing them that we're the ones that are trying to be the people that are, number one, protecting the Constitution, number two, voting for you, because all this BS that's happening right now, prices are still high. The cost of eggs are still high. People can't buy homes. And I think that's the one thing that we still need to figure out how to pivot back because that's where the Republicans are the weakest at. They own this economy now, and they're not doing stuff for everyday Americans right now. I could see you in your brain changing the word. My wife warned me before I left for work today, not to swear. But the problem is, I think we have to separate what we're hearing from kind of the D.C. crowd, from what we're hearing kind of in the streets, from what we're hearing about everyday common Americans. Because, you know, I go back to Arizona, they're actually not talking about USAID. And they're not talking about the courts. They're still talking about egg prices. They're still talking about the cost of everything. So one of the things we have to be very mindful of is that we may engage in a fight, but the rest of the American public may not be with us because they don't understand this fight. And we need to make sure that we're matching our politics to what actually is happening in the real world. Because sometimes when we have that disconnect, we miss, and then we miss really, really badly. And unfortunately, now we know, we can't miss. Because when we do, it has political fallout. Like the stuff that's happening right now is because we entirely miss where the American public was during the 2024 election. I want to take a step back because, as we've mentioned, Democrats are trying to redefine their party. And your victory in a state that Trump won has been framed as possibly offering a model for what kind of message actually works. You outperformed Harris in your state, meaning that you won over some Trump voters. Why do you think that happened? Because I do understand that not all Trump voters are actual straight down the line Trump voters. I think there's a lot of people that voted for Trump because they were frustrated with what was happening in this country. And we weren't afraid to reach out to them. And we went to some of the hardest places in the state, some Republican counties. We sat down with Trump supporters. We weren't afraid to talk to them. And we did it repeatedly. You think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters? I think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters. I think Democrats are afraid to talk to people that are going to criticize them. And I think that's, you're just, you know, in a state like Arizona, there's 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in Arizona. I had no choice. It was either do it or you're not going to make it. And so we went out there, we sat down, we met with them. And our messaging also was very, very clear to the everyday Arizonan, which I think is very different than from the national campaign was. Why do you think Democrats are afraid to talk to Trump voters? I don't know. I feel like if they, a lot of them had been doing it, I think they probably would have done a little better. Like, why aren't they going into the reddest areas of the, of the country and talking to them? You know, Donald Trump goes to Harlem. You know, do we go to the equivalent of, of Harlem for the red, you know, voter? No, we don't. I want to talk through some demographic groups that Democrats really need to win back if they want to be competitive. Everybody? Yeah. I mean, men, for example. You've been described to me as a bro. I mean, not in a bad way. You won Latino men by 30 points in an election that saw Trump dominate that group. I know men are a very sort of broad group, but what do you think Democrats have misunderstood about men? We could be working to make the status of men better without at the same time diminishing the status of women. And a lot of times we forget that we still need men to vote for us. That's how we still win elections. But we don't really talk about making the, the life of men better, working to make sure that they have wages so they could support their families. I also think like some of this is just like purely like psychological that a lot of times like we just can't put our finger on, but you know, during my campaign, I noticed when I was talking to men, especially Latino men about like the feeling of pride, bringing money home, being able to support your family, the feeling of bringing security, like for them, they, they, they wanted to hear that someone understood that need. And a lot of times we are so afraid, I think of communicating that to men because we think somehow we're going to also diminish the status of women. And I think that that's, that's, we need to understand that that's going to end up being a problem. The fact that we don't talk this way at all to them makes them just think that we're not really, we don't really care about them when in fact, even when we're not talking about them and we're not campaigning about them, the Democrats on par are actually very good about the status of working class men. And I think Democrats need to figure out how we communicate that to guys and be like, Hey, we're going to make sure that you're going to have a good paying job so you can start a family, go out. Like I, it was a joke, but I said a lot when I was talking to, you know, Latino men, like I'm going to make sure you get out of your mom's house, right? You get your troquita for English speakers. That means your truck, every Latino man wants a big ass truck, which is nothing wrong with that either. And you're going to go start your own job and you can become rich, right? These are the conversations that, that we should be having, you know, and like a lot, for some reason we have become, we're afraid of saying these types of things. We're afraid of saying like, Hey, let's help you get a job so you become rich. Like we use terms like bring more economic stability to you. Right. And like, these guys don't want that. They don't want economic stability. They want to like really live the American dream. And so honestly, the reason I think I did better than most male Democratic politicians is because I communicated that to them in a very simplistic terms and that that's it. I mean, I think one of the difficulties maybe for Democrats is that what you're describing is more traditional values, right? But people vote on value. But are you saying that Democrats should recognize that people want more traditional gender roles? No. Be less afraid of that? No. I think Democrats should recognize that people want them to understand that they matter. Right. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to say like, you know, it's, you know, the single mom is less important than the father. That's not what we're saying. But just saying like, yes, you matter too. You matter in this world, right? You are deserving of a government that's going to respond because supposedly as Democrats supposed to be fighting for everybody. But the way that these men think about things and look at the world, they don't see that. I mean, you know, as someone that grew up on job sites, construction sites, you know, I worked in factories. If you go to these construction sites, these factories, the type of communication you're hearing that these guys talking to each other, it's very much not at all what we think. Tell me what that means. Well, working class men don't really listen, especially Latino men don't really listen to political commercials. They don't watch TV news. They largely will talk amongst themselves. And sometimes other working class men will come in with their opinion. And that's the only thing they're hearing. That's it. And. There's the WhatsApp groups. Come on. Yeah. Those WhatsApp groups aren't good for Democrats either. No. And so we have to break that. I mean, so, you know, one of the things I did is like I would host, you know, morning tacos at work sites right during the election. So I would go set up at, you know, knowing when the 530 shift was coming off and I set up tacos and I'd hand out tacos to the dudes and I got talked to him about, you know, life. And we have to understand where they are. We have to understand what they're hearing, because what they're hearing is that the Democrats aren't really for them. And they're hanging out from the one dude that heard it from WhatsApp or the one dude that's listening to talk radio. And there's no one saying like, well, you know, actually, I heard from another guy that Democrats are actually doing this doesn't have just doesn't happen because we don't there's no way for us to give that information because we're not going to where they are. You know, after the midterms in 2022, when Democrats did better than expected, many Democrats and you included seem to take away that there wasn't this rightward shift among the Latino community. In fact, you said, and I'm quoting here, reporters were talking about realignment. There's no effing realignment. You said effing. I said effing. That's not the word you used. Why did you get it wrong? Because I was right then. You know, in 2022 is when I was the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. We had polling that showed that there was no slippage happening because men, especially Latino men were frustrated, but they felt that things were getting better. And there was also an understanding, especially from women, that, you know, Democrats were better for them with the recession, with the personal recession, not necessarily the government recession, continuing on more and more and more. And with housing pricing, not going down. That's when things just started sliding economically. We weren't meeting the demands of where they were. I think they were willing to be hopeful because Biden had just gotten in. A lot of the stimulus money still had not worn out, but starting around like early 2023, a lot of the stimulus money went away because we negotiate with the Republicans for it to go away. Interest rates stayed high. And you know, for a lot of families, Latino families, owning a home, buying a home is part of the American dream. And now it has gotten even further and further away. So the economics just did not improve. And as soon as some of us heard it, we started putting up the warning signs, but it just wasn't heard. Lastly, what also is a difference is that the way that Trump communicates is actually more apt to get younger Latino men voters. Because where they gather their information, where they listen to politics, is where Trump is more often versus where we are. He's on podcasts all the time. He's at UFC fights. He's at all these things where they actually see him being a real quote unquote man. And going into the election 2023, I also warned Democrats about that we needed to get out there. And I made a lot of recommendations that weren't listened to. Like I wanted President Biden to go to the Copa America game and sit next to some Latino celebrity. You know, I love boxing. I'm like, let's go to some boxing matches, right? Let's take some Democrats to boxing matches and meet where a lot of Latinos are. And the fact is when you go into a big election in 2024, and you're going to have a lot of young men coming to vote for the first time that didn't vote in 2022, and all they're learning about politics is through podcasts, through UFC fights, you know, we're going to start losing that vote if we don't. And we did. And we need to figure out how to get into that world. I was actually shocked to learn that President Trump was the first sitting president to go to a Super Bowl game. Yeah. And he'll do everything right. And like, why are we not doing it? I'll tell you why. Because I have heard this before. And I'm not going to tell you which politician was worried about this, but their staff told me like, I don't want my guy getting booed. It's like, well, I mean, like, so you don't expose yourself to anybody, but then you also don't expose yourself to anybody. And again, this is just the president. This is everybody really running last year. This is the thing that we have to understand as Democrats, like if we're not willing to be booed, take chances. The people that really get hurt are the people that we're supposedly in office for, right? The people that are barely making it now, and they're going to be hurt because we didn't take chances. I want to turn to the subject of class. I interviewed J.D. Vance before the election. And you know, even though your politics are obviously very different than his, your backgrounds do share similar traits, working class, raised by single mothers, military service in Iraq, went to the Ivy League. And that story of class transition does seem to resonate with voters. Well, I think most voters want to believe and do believe in the American dream. And I think when they see examples of that being true, that gives them some hope, right? And I'm sure J.D. heard this, but I certainly heard about this on the campaign trail from single moms who brought their kids up to me and like, I want them to meet you because I want them to be like you. He's going off the same situation that I am or that you were, right? And, you know, sometimes people miss it. I remember during my campaigns, some of my advisors said, you know, you can't talk about Harvard. I'm like, well, why not? Like, well, you want to talk, you want working class people to like you. If you tell them you went to Harvard, you're going to remind them that you're not part of that. I'm like, no, that's, you're not getting it. Working class people appreciate kids going to college. They appreciate especially kids that came from poverty going to college because that's part of the story, part of the American dream. And, you know, I think whether it comes from left or right, the example really matters, especially when things are rough. But you need that kind of hope to kind of hang on to because that's what helps you get through those days, especially those hard days is knowing that things will get better. You know, this is psychologically what people miss about this campaigns. When people started feeling like it's not going to get better, that was like a, that should have been a big tell that things were going to go south. The thing I really struggle to reconcile is on the one hand, you have voters saying that the economy and inflation are their top issues and they feel the pain of price increases, which is completely understandable. On the other hand, under Trump, we now have the richest cabinet in modern history, the world's richest.","segments":[{"id":0,"avg_logprob":-0.2762022614479065,"compression_ratio":1.349753737449646,"end":14.279999732971191,"no_speech_prob":0.5739824771881104,"seek":0,"start":0.0,"temperature":0.0,"text":"
