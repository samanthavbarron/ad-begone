{"duration":1062.8299560546875,"language":"english","text":"From the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today. Over the past week, President Trump dramatically ceded the stage to Elon Musk in the Oval Office, turned the Democratic mayor of New York City into a kind of political pawn, and ensured that Vladimir Putin begins peace talks with Ukraine on Russia's terms. To make sense of all of that, I turned to three of my colleagues, White House reporters Maggie Haberman, David Sanger, and Zolan Kano-Youngs. It's Friday, February 14th. Friends, welcome back to The Roundtable. But first, happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Happy to spend it with you. I mean, who else would you spend it with? I can think of one person. I can, too. I can, too. You have a wonderful husband. David, appreciate you joining us from Munich. I was going to say from Paris, city of love. That was the plan, but you changed location since we- Well, that was two days ago with Vice President Vance, yeah? Yep. You've been traveling with the Vice President. Zolan and Maggie, appreciate you coming to us from our studio in Washington, D.C. I just want to set up this conversation. Loosely speaking, our theme this week is projections of power, exercises of power by the Trump administration, both overseas and here at home. And we're going to start here at home. It feels like the story of this presidency so far is the extraordinary wielding of power by President Trump and a remarkable wielding of power by Elon Musk, private citizen and the world's richest man. And they've been happening simultaneously and seemingly a little bit independently. And this week, we saw those two things come together in a very vivid and at times weird way in the Oval Office. Maggie, for anyone who didn't see this or watch it, can you just describe this scene? It was pretty remarkable, Michael. Elon Musk joined Donald Trump in the Oval Office with Elon Musk's four-year-old child named X, just like the social media website that used to be Twitter that Elon Musk has renamed. And it was for an executive order signing related to how Doge, Musk's so-called cost cutting initiative, interacts with the hiring process in the federal government. And Trump really just turned it over to Musk. And Musk just held forth for many, many minutes. I think it was much of the roughly 30-minute event. And he described what he's doing. He kept talking about all of the so-called fraud and waste and abuse that he says they have found. The most striking allegation for which he provided no evidence and still has not, as far as I know, was that some government workers were taking kickbacks, that they were getting percentages. I believe it was specifically of USAID spending. But Trump was relegated to sort of a spectator in his own office, just sitting at the desk and nodding and occasionally chiming in and criticizing judges. And what was really striking about it, Michael, is that it looked to those of us who have watched him for a long time as if Trump was not enjoying this. I talked to a number of his advisors afterwards. They said he was fine with it. They said that he – and I don't think that they're making it up. I think that he was defending his guy, Elon Musk, who has gone above and beyond in many ways to try to prove loyalty to Trump. And Trump really likes having the richest man in the world seeking his approval. All right. Well, Zolan and David, I want to bring you in. What immediately stood out about this scene was not just the fact that Elon Musk was there defending and justifying his unusual role. It was just the fact of him holding court next to a sitting President Trump for 30 minutes in this room that is the very definition of American presidential power. It was the stature that it conferred on Musk. And you all know this, but there's been this running motif that Musk is a kind of co-president. And Time magazine went so far over the past couple of days as to put Musk on the cover of its latest issue, sitting behind the Resolute desk with a coffee mug in his hand. And this scene didn't seem to combat that or did it? I mean, I cover the White House now, but I used to cover a cabinet agency during Trump round one. And I remember covering that cabinet agency. Officials used to talk about all the time how if they were going to do an announcement, going to have a policy change, Trump needed the spotlight. Like they were very conscious about that. So to see this scene of the richest man in the world standing in front of cameras, articulating this real attempt to reshape the federal bureaucracy into something that's in Trump's image, it was something that I didn't think I would see covering Trump round one. Yeah, I'd never seen anything like it covering five presidents. And I would have to say that two things really jumped out at me. The first was that I think one of the reasons that Trump let this go on was that he thought that having the world's richest man talk about this cost-cutting move gave him some credibility. Huh. Musk or Trump. Added to what was going on. Who got the credibility? That Trump got credibility from having Musk saying basically, I'm bringing the cost-cutting strategies of X and Tesla and SpaceX and those efficiencies to your government and doing this on a scale that has never been done before. The second part that was fascinating to me was what was missing from it. What was missing from it was what is the purpose of having these government agencies? What is the purpose of government? So in describing USAID, which I think has some of the most courageous people I have ever met in the U.S. government going out in the world, putting themselves in danger on the front line with none of the weapons that the U.S. military goes out and has at those moments. Instead, he was basically describing them as people on the take. Right. There seems to be an interesting thing happening where the president and Elon Musk believe that to justify their cost-cutting, they need to find and highlight corruption. Just egregious cases of bad behavior when it seems for the most part that's probably not what they're going to find. Why is it that they're having such a hard time just saying we want to cut government because we want to cut government? Why do they feel the need to brand everything as corrupt, as kickbacks, to make claims that so malign the workforce? For which there's no evidence. Right. I think that well, at least there may be evidence, but they have not shared it with us. Number one, it's Donald Trump's default setting is to call things corrupt when he doesn't like them, to call things corrupt when they disagree with him. I do think that Trump is very radicalized about the government he is leading. I think that has happened since the investigations into him in his first term. I think since the multiple criminal indictments he faced, all of the civil cases that he faced. I do think that Trump's contempt for the federal government is genuine, but Trump comes historically from a period in time and a place, New York, 1960s, 70s, 80s, that was run by machine politics, where lots of aspects of government, frankly, some aspects of the media, some aspects of the real estate industry were tinged with corruption. Trump's sort of basic belief, and we hear him articulate this in various ways, is everything is a little corrupt, and he is suggesting in this case it's a lot. The question also asked, why can't they just say this is about cutting government? Right. I mean, we know from reporting this is not just about cutting the fat off of government, that this is not just about limiting federal spending, that this is also about getting people in office that will implement your agenda without asking questions, without putting up a bureaucratic hurdle. So it's not just about cutting spending. For him right now, it seems like the definition of corruption is also changing. Corruption, as you were just saying, can be a policy difference. That's right. I just want to close out this conversation about Elon Musk, because this idea, this motif of a co-presidency is so much in the air, I just want to get some clarity on this. Maggie, is there a version of this where we should see Trump giving Elon Musk this kind of a platform as him actually exerting some power over Musk? I mean, if you watch the president set it up, he said, I've asked Elon Musk to come here to offer a few remarks. And even though Trump was sitting there at their Resolute desk not saying much during the entire time Musk was talking, he was sitting at the Resolute desk. That's his desk. It was very clear he was the president. Is there a way of flipping this around a little bit and seeing this as him kind of bringing Musk to heel? Oh, 100%. I think the way you just described it is exactly it. Is Musk showing some level of dutiful obligation to Donald Trump? There's no question. And to that point, I would just add a sort of remarkable point that emerged this week. The Wall Street Journal first reported it and we confirmed it. X, which is owned by Musk, settled for multi-million dollars. We don't know the exact figure. It's somewhere in the area of $10 million. A lawsuit that Trump had brought against the site when it was Twitter, owned by other people, and his account was banned after January 6, 2021. So essentially the site, and I don't know exactly how the finances of X work in terms of Musk's ownership, et cetera, but this is his website. And it has now paid Donald Trump a substantial amount of money. And Trump could have said, you know, let's not do that. Right. You're working for me now. Not a big deal. Right. That's not what happened, evidently. Wow. I didn't know that over the past week, among all the remarkable things, Elon Musk essentially cut a check to Donald Trump for many millions of dollars. One of his companies did, yes. Yep. So Musk and Doge and all this cost cutting and conflict of interest risk overshadowing something else really important that happened this week, which is that the Trump administration, its Justice Department, asked prosecutors in New York to drop sweeping federal corruption charges against the city's mayor here, Eric Adams. Maggie, you've covered this story very closely. Can you just remind us very briefly of the basics of this case and how we got to this point where the Trump administration is demanding that charges for a big city Democratic mayor be dropped? Michael, there are so many inputs as how we got here, so I will just try to do the short version. Eric Adams. I trust you to do this. I appreciate you. And you'll let me know if I don't get there. Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges in September of 2024. The basics for bribery involves airline ticket upgrades and essentially a quid pro quo with a foreign government, Turkey in particular. Trump started talking in December about possibly pardoning Adams. He had treated Adams as a fellow traveler in what Trump calls the weaponized justice system and he's been very clear about that. Adams has also started trying to forge a very clear relationship with Trump. He went down to Palm Beach to meet with him. In January, the SDNY, the prosecutors in Manhattan, federal prosecutors, filed a court filing saying that they had uncovered evidence of additional criminal conduct by Adams. That signaled there could be more charges filed that could be more serious. Trump clearly does not think the charges against Adams as they are now are serious. Earlier this week, the acting deputy attorney general who is one of Donald Trump's many personal lawyers and is now in that role, directed the Southern District to dismiss the case, drop the charges. It does require a judge doing it, but also said that they would leave open a review of the case until after the November 2025 mayoral election. So it's not dead. It's just not happening right now. As they say in that memo, it has impeded Adams' ability to do his job, including helping on their immigration crackdown in New York. I thought that- You're nodding your head. There seems to be a quid pro quo implied here, which is that- Which they say is not, by the way, to be clear, but yes. The implied give and take here is that the Democratic mayor of America's biggest city will become an ally of the president, and most importantly, not a critic of things like his immigration agenda, if and once this administration drops these charges. I thought this was really a takeaway that there actually wasn't an assessment in this memo on the evidence of this case, but the takeaway was rather an assessment, a political assessment really, of how Eric Adams would be able to implement Trump's immigration crackdown. That was explicitly said here. They explicitly said that they weren't making this decision based on the evidence, in fact, which was extraordinary. Right. I just want to be clear what you guys are saying. The Justice Department, in saying they think these charges should be dropped, basically said, we'd really like to work with this mayor to conduct immigration raids and get undocumented immigrants out of New York City. We see this case as a hurdle in order to doing that. That was the primary reason. It's worth noting that Eric Adams as well, early on in the Biden administration, was one of the earliest Democrats to attack the previous administration over immigration, made a lot of noise, which this current president also noticed. It's also worth noting that Eric Adams' lawyer is also Elon Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro. Blowing my mind just a little bit. David, for many people, this scenario is pretty straightforwardly a subversion of the normal system of justice in the country. Putting that aside for a moment, if you wish to, just as importantly, it would seem to make the mayor of New York City something of a, and I'm going to use this word and you all can correct me if you think it's too strong, a pawn of the president. Because it would seem, from what Maggie said, that their plan is to drop the case but say they could bring it back. That message would seem to be, we can make all your problems go away, Mr. Mayor, or we can make your problems come right back. You're right, Michael. There is a sort of Damocles that is hanging over Eric Adams with every decision that he has to make. Every decision about whether to let an ICE raid proceed in his city. Every decision about whether or not he is going to oppose the president of the United States on a policy that might affect New York City residents. And with each one of those, he's going to have to say, is it worth it to stand up to this man if he can bring the Justice Department back on me on these cases at any given moment? That would end my career. It not only end his career, but if you look at some of these charges, you know, there's the possibility of jail time out here. So I have never seen a roarer exercise of presidential power. He could have just given him a pardon, in which case Adams would be free to go do whatever he wants to go do. So now, instead, he has simply, or the Justice Department, we don't know if the president was directly involved, has simply suspended the case. You're saying there's a real Machiavellian value in arranging the situation such that Adams simply cannot afford to not do the president's bidding. It certainly looks that way. In fact, that sort of underrates Machiavelli, I think, in some degree. This goes beyond just the Eric Adams case, too. I think what this all is showing is he doesn't want to limit his influence and power just to the executive branch, just to Washington. It is extraordinary to see a president say, my power will not be limited by the checks and balance of the federal government. I will involve myself in cities, in the private sector, in the global stage. I will put that Trump stamp on really all matters of society in the country right now. And not only will I do that, but I am going to do it all out in the open. These are not backroom conversations. This is, we are doing this, and this is how I'm going to go about it. And it doesn't really bother me if it bothers you, because unless you can stop me, I'm going to do it. Well, we're going to take a break, and Zolan, when we come back, we're going to return to the phrase you just used, overseas, and talk about projections of power in international affairs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
