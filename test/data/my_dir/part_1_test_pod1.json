{"duration":1062.8299560546875,"language":"english","text":"Welcome back to David, Zola, and Maggie. I want to turn to the president's actions this week overseas, because after focusing so heavily on his battle against the federal bureaucracy, he's now inserted himself quite forcefully into two of the world's biggest conflicts, the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. Let's start with Ukraine. David, in just about the past 48 hours, it feels like Trump tossed out most of, if not all of, America's existing approach to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which was to isolate Russia and to support Ukraine. Can you briefly tick through what the administration did and where it leaves the conflict? Well, let's start with what the old policy was. The old policy was the United States will do everything it can, short of sending troops to help support the Ukrainians against an invasion that they neither prompted nor saw. That was the Biden position. The second argument... We should explain that when you're in Europe, that's what the sirens sound like behind you. I was going to ask you if you really wanted to hear these, but now you know I'm really immune. No, you're not faking it. It's like a Mission Impossible movie. It's such a better siren song than what we have here. You were saying? So the old strategy also was, whenever we are ready to go into a negotiation to end the war, it will be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And that means that the Ukrainians will be at the center of the negotiation. And no one's going to give away their country the way one did in colonial times. This is going to be the Ukrainians working it out with the Russians. Imperialism will not be rewarded. That's right. And imperialism will not be rewarded meant that Vladimir Putin couldn't come away from this with more land or a better situation than he had before. Vladimir Putin couldn't come away from this in a situation where he would be ready a few years from now to finish the job and take the rest of Ukraine. So fast forward to what happened after dancing around each other for weeks. Putin and President Trump finally get on the phone for 90 minutes. When it's all done, Trump comes out and says, we're on the way to a peace deal. There's going to be a negotiation missing from all of this. The Europeans and the Ukrainians. Right. We're talking to you on Thursday midday. But earlier in the day here in Europe, Zelensky came out and said, I'm not going along with any agreement about my country, that I'm not involved in negotiating. Maggie Insel, I want to understand why a president who wrote a book called The Art of the Deal, who sees himself as a master negotiator, would start a peace process that many people believe should start now between Russia and Ukraine by giving away so much leverage to Russia. On top of what David described, the Trump administration in the past couple of days has said that Ukraine should not enter NATO, the alliance that would protect it from future Russian invasion. It has said that Ukraine is never going to return to its pre-invasion borders. Between those two proclamations and Trump's call with Putin, it really does feel like he's starting a peace process almost entirely on Russia's terms. Why would he give away that much leverage to Russia? You answered your question, because his interest is not in preserving what Ukraine wants. He is much more interested in forging a durable relationship between the U.S. and Russia. He is very interested in his personal relationship with Putin. To be clear about this, he is very obsessed with nuclear war and nuclear capabilities. This has been one of his obsessions about Russia for years. There was one piece of leverage he did not give away, and he was open about it, which is that he's going to continue providing aid to Ukraine, because he does recognize that there is leverage there, but he also put some conditions on it. It's not a total giveaway of all the chits, but he is making clear that he believes that this will arrive at a faster place and a place that he can live with. He is a skeptic of Zelensky, and he is a skeptic of Ukraine. He has been very clear about that for a long time. I'm coming to learn, too, that it's very difficult to put Trump into one of the traditional labels that we use- 100%. For foreign policy. Correct. For foreign policy. For any policy. Covering this more and more, the word I just keep coming back to is transactional. He has this view where each nation, allies, are just taking advantage of the United States, and what are we getting in return? Even in the case of Ukraine, we've been hearing more and more about, yes, he did say he would commit to aid, but also he wants critical earth minerals as well now. What can the U.S. gain from this? When you have somebody where that's the through line, just a transactional approach, with that comes unpredictability as well. You're no longer governed by a set of rules of acting a certain way with allies and another way with adversaries. That's exactly right. It seems like it just has resulted in global leaders across the world, from Europe to the Middle East now, walking on eggshells. What else it does is it takes you back to what Donald Trump has been saying was his favorite era, the McKinley era, the 1890s, where we're taking lands, in that case, the Philippines, Guam, and so forth. Now what he wants is Greenland, the Panama Canal, and to own Gaza. But what that really tells you is that everything that we have done since World War II to build up alliances and basically establish that people should ally with the United States on a basis of principle, not on basis of American power, is out the window. Maggie, that's one of my questions, is I know we're struggling to pin down a Trump ideology when it comes to foreign affairs, Zolan, you're describing it as transactional, but I wonder if we're underestimating the element of imperialism that David just hinted at, and if what's partly going on here is that Trump is giving Russia the deference that he wants the world to give him if he tries to, say, take Greenland or the Panama Canal or Gaza? That's part of it, but he's doing that because he likes the way Vladimir Putin rules, which is, as he would say, about a range of people with an iron fist. That is what he likes. That is what appeals to him. So that is why he is giving that deference. I think Zolan is exactly right, and I would just add that this is where the leverage over whomever comes into play, and this is how our Eric Adams conversation relates to this. Trump is showing all of these foreign leaders that he will do these kinds of things at home, too. He will do these kinds of things within the US. He will try to make his strength known locally, even though there is supposed to be some level of autonomy within states. But yes, I do think that there is a growingly visible imperialism. I personally don't think Donald Trump is any different than he was in his first term. He just happens to actually understand more about where levers are. But this was hidden from view, this side of him, and his impulses were curbed by a number of advisors. It goes back to now it is just all hanging out there because he can. Maggie, I want to pick up on something you're saying about how this all relates to the way his administration is treating something as local as the Adams case and how that has global implications. How does he apply that to Gaza? The president has articulated this plan, which some don't see as literal, some do, to permanently remove all two million Palestinians in Gaza, move them to neighboring Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, and then have the US take over Gaza and lead its redevelopment into what Trump has called a city for the peoples of the world. Many people read that to mean mostly Israelis. What ends up happening in the past couple of days, and I know a few of you covered this, is that the leader of Jordan, King Abdullah, one of the countries that would have to accept Palestinians, comes to the White House, and Trump is trying to sell him on this plan. And it's very clear how uncomfortable the leader of Jordan is. So I want you to apply that prism, Maggie, Zolan, David, that you just did, of the way Trump uses power locally, how it applies to an international situation like this. Well, and it was more than just selling him, and this I think will get to your question. It was more than just selling him, he put the pressure on him when he was in the White House. With the cameras rolling. With the cameras rolling. We've had some quick discussions just now, and we're going to have some longer discussions after this. King Abdullah's sitting next to President Trump. President Trump is asked, you have this plan to forcibly remove Palestinians to these neighboring countries. The king of one of those nations does not want to do that. Mr. President, why should the king take in the Palestinian people? He's made clear he doesn't want to. Well, I don't know. But he may have just something to say, because we discussed just briefly, I think maybe you want to say it now, or? And then Trump started to answer by saying, well, we just had a nice conversation, and then immediately turns and puts the king of Jordan on the spot. What did the king say back? Well, in that moment, he used what a lot of other leaders have used thus far with Trump, flattery, placating. One of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children that are either cancer children or in a very ill state to Jordan as quickly as possible. He basically was saying to the president, trying to make the case that they are helping Palestinians in Gaza. I didn't know that, what you just said, 2,000 children with cancer or other problems. And that's really a beautiful gesture. That's really good. And we appreciate it. But he didn't forcibly push back at that point when he was in front of President Trump. And it was only until hours later that the king of Jordan posted on social media basically saying our stance remains the same. We do not want Palestinians forcibly displaced. But that was when he was outside the White House, away from the cameras, now away from Trump at that point. And yes, that message from the king of Jordan may go to his domestic audience. I think President Trump also got the scene he wanted for his audience as well. 100%. The dynamics might be a little bit different, but the basic through line is the same with both the Eric Adams case and that meeting with King Abdullah and what Trump is trying to extract from him, which is I want something and you are reliant on me. In Abdullah's case, it is aid. Right. Billions of dollars a year that the U.S. gives to Jordan. Correct. In Eric Adams case, it is his freedom. He is going to apply pressure and he's going to do it pretty plainly. Michael is another through line. Think of the Ukrainians and think of the Palestinians. So in both cases, they're in Trump's mind, not major players here. They are pawns to be moved around. Trump has never once, since he's raised this idea, gone and tackled the question that the Geneva Convention actually forbids the mass movement of ethnic groups. So he views international treaties, international law as obstacles to his plan. And the way he's going to get past it, he believes, is by pressuring allies over whom he's got some leverage. And that would be, in this case, Jordan and Egypt. Right. What you're really getting at here is that when it comes to the domestic and the international front, this version of the Trump presidency, this undiluted, unrestrained, Maggie, to use your words, version of it, is one where the victors win totally. Right. And in the case of Russia, Ukraine, Russia will win almost totally. In the case of Israel versus Hamas, when it comes to Gaza, Israel will pretty much win totally. And in his interactions with the bureaucracy or Eric Adams, it will be Trump who will win totally. You are hitting on a very important dynamic with Trump. And this one has been consistent for a very long time, if not forever. Everything is zero sum. Everything is zero sum. There are clear winners. There are clear losers. And so everything with Trump is a maximalist position. And then he sees, you know, if he has to even walk things back in a different direction. As I was getting off the plane here from Munich, I ran into a European diplomat I've known for a long time. And we were discussing this dynamic, what we've seen in Ukraine, what we've seen in Gaza. And he said, you know, it goes back to Thucydides, who wrote the history of the Peloponnesian War. And that famous quote we all had to, like, learn in 11th grade, which is, the powerful do whatever they can and the weak do whatever they must. I'm sure I've got the phrasing slightly wrong there. But that's the world that Donald Trump sees at home and abroad. Well, on that unexpected, incredibly erudite literary note, David, thank you. Zolan, thank you. Maggie, thank you. And again, happy Valentine's Day. Thank you, Michael. And honored to be here with you for it. Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. Great to be with you, all three. On Thursday afternoon, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan resigned, rather than obey the order from Trump's Justice Department to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. In a letter, the U.S. attorney said she could no longer remain in the job because, quote, The law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged. Soon after, the Justice Department sought to reassign the case to a different team of lawyers in Washington. But the two attorneys who run that team, as well as three of their colleagues, also resigned, rather than follow the order. The six resignations were a remarkable rebuke of the administration's decision to end the case against Mayor Adams. We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today. In the latest legal setback to President Trump's executive orders, a federal judge ordered the White House to keep funding hospitals that offer gender transition treatments to people under the age of 19. Trump had sought to block that funding, which was already approved by Congress on ideological grounds. But in the ruling, the judge said that Trump's order encroached on Congress's power and put trans youth at, quote, And on Thursday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services and sworn in during a ceremony in the Oval Office. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who failed to win a single Democratic vote in the Senate, had explicitly sought the role of health secretary in return for his endorsement of Trump during the campaign.
