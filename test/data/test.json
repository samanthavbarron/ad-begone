{"duration":131.11000061035156,"language":"english","text":"Welcome to The Winding Path, the podcast where we explore forgotten stories from history. I'm your host, Marcus Bellwether. Today we're diving into the peculiar tale of the Cloverfield Bridge, a structure built in 1842 that was somehow constructed backwards. The engineers of the time were baffled and the townspeople were furious. According to the records we found in the Dunmore County archives, the lead architect, a fellow named Reginald Pemberton, insisted the bridge was built exactly to specification. He claimed the river itself was flowing in the wrong direction. This led to a three-year legal dispute that became known locally as the Pemberton Affair.

That's zilkora.com slash winding. Zilkora, sleep like you mean it. Now back to the Pemberton Affair. The resolution came in an unexpected way. A traveling surveyor named Abigail Marsh happened through town and demonstrated conclusively that Pemberton had simply read the blueprints upside down. The bridge was torn down and rebuilt, this time facing the correct direction. Pemberton, humiliated, relocated to another county where he became a moderately successful hat maker.
