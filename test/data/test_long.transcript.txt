Good morning and welcome to Between the Lines, a weekly deep dive into the world of independent literature. I'm your host, Julian Ashford. On today's show, we're talking about the resurgence of serialized fiction. For decades, the publishing industry dismissed serialized stories as relics of the Victorian era, but a new generation of writers is proving that releasing novels chapter by chapter can actually build more engaged and passionate audiences.

Our first guest today wrote an entire twelve part novella series that she released one chapter per week over the course of a year. Each installment ended on a cliffhanger, and her readership grew from about two hundred people to over forty thousand by the final chapter. She's here to tell us how she did it and what she learned along the way.

Thanks for having me, Julian. Honestly, when I started the project, I had no idea if anyone would stick around past chapter three. The key was treating each chapter like its own self-contained episode while still advancing the larger arc. I also made a point of engaging with readers between installments, asking them questions, responding to theories, and even incorporating some of their feedback into the story.

That's fascinating. Now you mentioned incorporating reader feedback. Can you give us an example of that? I imagine it's a delicate balance between staying true to your vision and giving the audience what they want.

[content] (voice: nova)
Absolutely. There was one character, a minor side character named Elden, who readers absolutely fell in love with. I had originally planned for him to appear in just two chapters, but the response was so overwhelming that I expanded his role significantly. He ended up being central to the climax of the whole series. But I was careful, I only expanded things that genuinely served the story. I never let popularity dictate a plot point that would undermine the narrative.

That sounds like a masterclass in audience engagement. Let's talk about the business side of things. You released this for free initially. How did you eventually monetize it, and would you recommend that approach to other writers?

[content] (voice: nova)
So the free release was strategic. I wanted to build an audience first and worry about revenue later. Once the series was complete, I compiled it into a single volume, did a professional edit pass, and sold it as an ebook and paperback. The built-in audience meant I had thousands of people ready to buy on launch day. I also did a limited edition hardcover with bonus content that sold out in forty eight hours. So yes, giving it away first actually made me more money in the long run.

Let's shift gears and talk about another trend in independent publishing. The rise of collaborative fiction, where multiple authors contribute to a shared universe. This has been happening in fan communities for years, but now we're seeing it professionalized, with structured writing teams and shared style guides.

I recently spoke with the organizers of the Meridian Collective, a group of seven writers who co-created an expansive fantasy world. Each writer is responsible for a different region of the world, and their stories intersect and overlap in fascinating ways. The logistics alone are mind-boggling, they use shared documents, timelines, and even a custom wiki to keep everything consistent.

[content] (voice: fable)
What strikes me most about the Meridian Collective is how they handle creative disagreements. They told me they have a formal arbitration process. If two writers want contradictory things to happen in the shared timeline, they present their cases to the group and vote. But there's also a wildcard rule: once per series, any writer can invoke an override and push through a plot point without group approval. It keeps things unpredictable.

Before we wrap up, I want to mention a few upcoming books from independent authors that I'm particularly excited about. First, there's The Cartographer's Dilemma by Soren Blackwell, a mystery set in a fictional mapping agency where the maps keep changing overnight. Then we have Rust and Reverie by Amara Osei, a post-industrial fantasy about a blacksmith who discovers her metalwork is coming to life.
